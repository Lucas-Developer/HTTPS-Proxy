# HTTPS Proxy

This is a simple proxy server using [request.js](https://github.com/request/request) and
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)' builtin [HTTP library](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html)
to rewrite incoming requests for sites using the HTTP protocol to use HTTPS.

It achieves this using the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/)'s
[HTTPS Everywhere](https://github.com/EFForg/https-everywhere) ruleset
([official site](https://www.eff.org/HTTPS-EVERYWHERE)) and part of the codebase.
